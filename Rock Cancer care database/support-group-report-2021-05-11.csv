"2021-05-05","","Anita","","","","","East County","6","0","1","4","Judy-Judy is currently struggling. She had not been feeling well recently. Finally went into have some blood test done and found out her thyroid is not functioning properly. She has not spoken to the doctor but thinks it could be hypothyroidism and is afraid of the new disease. The fear was crippling such that she was not even able to read her Bible yesterday which has been a ritual for her. The group gave her words of encouragement reminding her that fear is a sign of Satan not a God who is of love and the Holy Spirit will protect her. She was not able to stay on the call because she was not feeling well and we all will continue to pray for her and give her strength through this difficult time.

Susan- gave us a praise report. She recently had her third chemo therapy session. After the first and second sessions are counts dramatically decreased from 144 to 25 after this first session and 10 after the second session. She was waiting to see what it is going to be after this session. She still has some issues with her mouth and food but appears better. She has been having issues lately with sleep and also a history of restless legs. Sometime she watches movies and other times she may be up cleaning. Usually drinking a cup of decaf coffee with cream or milk helps but she finds that she has been lactose intolerant and have been trying to avoid dairy. Makes exception when she can’t sleep. Ask the group for any suggestions regarding sleep. Suggestions included  types of tea such as sleepy time plus lavender products. Meditation and reading also suggested.

Sydney- Recently experienced spinal pain. Had a visit and provider gave her steroids which she does not like. In the past she has had back within muscle relaxer and try to get that prescribed by her neurologist but never heard back from them. Ended up speaking to another provider who prescribed Norco which she did not want but went to the pharmacy anyway to pick it up and found out the back with and had been filled by her neurologist. Perplexed why she was not notified of this but happy to get it in her back is much improved. The neurologist also scheduled her for her MRI and waiting for the results. Continues to try to adjust to a new neurologist. She continues to consume caffeine containing beverages multiple per day even though she’s not working. We discussed the health benefits of consumption of that much caffeine. She also has not completed her school project which now she has an ultimatum to turn it in by Monday or she will get no credit. Sydney is trying to get 100% credit trying to talk to the course Director almost daily who is getting annoyed with her. Encouraged Sydney to make a decision and do the submit button as soon as possible so that can be over and she can get on with her degree and life.

Maya- She is preparing for surgery but will be done after her birthday. Wants to know if she will be able to drive. We counseled  her again about resting after any type of surgery and not trying to do things like she had before hospitalizations. Her doctors remarked that she is walking better so they want to test her nerve sometime in the future because they are shocked since she had so much nerve damage in the past.
There has been a lot of stress and her family. Her daughter has been harassed by her ex-husband‘s wife lately especially on social media. Next month will be a court case and she will be 18 soon. Your daughter wants to leave San Diego area. Mom and other family live in orange county and thinking about going up there but Maya really doesn’t want to. Also it appears that they want to drop the case that she was trying to file against her ex-husband feeling it was not worthy of pursuing.

Nikki- it was great to see her again. She continues to have a very hard time with everything. It is overwhelming at best. She is battling probably over 30 different doctor and their associated tests. She is also trying to help her son who was recently diagnosed with lupus besides Hashimoto’s thyroid disease and a few other things. He’s only 21 and hard to grasp the severity of his illness. They do not have a great relationship as there is some resentment because of Niki‘s previous history of alcoholism. Trying to deal with their relationship as well as issue their chronic illnesses has been tough. At this time she feels like she is in a dark place barely hanging on but she is faithful and knows God is good. We continue to uplift Niki and reinforce that God is good and has a plan. He will never leave or for sake her. Sydney shared that she had gone through some of the same things both Niki and her son had when she was young and she’s willing to speak to her son if he desires.","Illness/sickness

She is also having issues with her new neurologist. Some of their conversations makes her suspect if this is the right specialist for her. It appears she is dictating her healthcare plan rather than the new specialist. Also feels the neurologist either isn’t writing certain things down to remember their previous conversation or is distracted unlike her previous neurologist. She has not gotten her Covid vaccination yet because they are planning chemotherapy early May. 

Susan - Is doing a little bit better today. Her mouth sores have improved. She is a little tired today after working with a  person who comes in to assist her with house chores. Today that person helped go through some books.
She will have her third chemo treatment on Monday. Not sure when she will be able to get out even for a support group meeting if we start seeing each other in person. It will depend on her white blood cell count levels.

Delores- feels better since her granddaughter has re-entered into school five days a week from 9 to 3. That gives her a break and hopefully her granddaughter will be more productive. She continues  to have a joint problem especially her knees. Was told to do some x-rays and to follow up with the doctor regarding injections. Has gained weight especially during the Covid. And knows that weight I s contributing to her pain. Admits that she had gained weight, secondary to food choices

Maya- she is contemplating the removal of her gallbladder next month. Trying to hold off until after her birthday when she will turn 40. She is also trying to return to the workforce after she has recovered from gallbladder surgery. Thinks she will try to go back into the insurance business like she had before since she can  make pretty decent money in order to support her and her daughter without the financial added stress

She recently started back doing physical therapy again after about a month. Brittan went today and had a good session. The therapist will try to also figure out what might be causing her electric shocks. Brittan has a rescue dog which is been a tremendous help to her over the past few years.

She only asked for continued prayer.

Judy- has been doing fairly well overall. Does not mention incapacitated pain or major depression like before. She has had more interaction with her granddaughter and will be going up to her daughters house in the coming week to help babysit. Daughter is working from home so she will be around even though Judy will be the principal caregiver during the day. She will also get to spend time with family during this holiday season which is great as in previous years that was not the case.

Maya-has been doing a little bit better. Try not to overdo it. Has some issues with her ex and upcoming court date scheduled in January which adds more stress to her life and her daughters. Maya is attached to her daughter’s service dog more than herdaughter at this time. I think the reason is because she tends to feed and walk the dog daily. Plus the dog also sleeps in her room. It is good companionship. Still on the quest looking for cauliflower orange chicken from Trader Joe’s. Has been to at least five different locations without finding it.","Children of God

Still stressed over the chain of events related to her grandson. Issues with granddaughter Ella persists. Having joint pains and may get injection sometime in the future. Just asks for prayer.

Has been doing more  both at home and also doing some deliveries which she is not supposed to do for 6 to 8 weeks after the surgery. She was spotting. Her doctor mentioned it was because she was doing things she should not be doing during this time of recuperation. Felt like she was caught in between because they had no income. As it is she is able to pay rent but that’s about it. She is stressed over not being able to pay other bills.

Her daughter was released but still has a court date in January and cannot be in contact with her son at this time.

One of the things had to do with the music in her area, that she did not feel appropriate so had different music than the rest of the store. Also had issues with the new neurologist’s staff mthat she has not met yet but their office could not write a note with her modified restrictions. She ended up getting in the head of neurology to write the note that’s been written for her for the past five years. Getting into the holiday season she needs the restrictions so that they will not work her more than she should because would cause too fatigued.Sydney recently celebrated her birthday which she enjoyed with her best friend. Still having issues with her dad’s wife as they’ve been clashing for years.

Asked her to keep us posted if she needed help but thought her mom would help if needed.

She is having pain and feeling tired. Had questions about showering and food. Wanted confirmation that she could not shower and she had to be on soft foods only. 

Sydney-States this is getting to be the busiest time of the year at Macy’s where she works. Sometimes she bears the brunt of  customers complaining.  She has noted more anxiety lately. Had an anxiety reaction when she was in the bank. Face timing mom when that occurred and one employee tried to get into the conversation. Had multiple people including two or three bank employees try to talk to her and even one of them placed their hand on her shoulder. Another got into her personal space. She ended up leaving. Sydney will end up meeting a new neurologist soon since her FMLA expires next week . Also  work related restrictions paperwork expires soon too. She needs that because you’re going from 8 to 10 hour days.

Debra - Recently lost her husband to cancer and they have a 12-year-old son Vincent. Initially wanted husband to attend and she thought about volunteering. Things went downhill fast when he had recurrence and was taken home-around 6 weeks. She’s looking for support and will soon get counseling for both herself and her son through hospice. Taking it day by day. Has some family support. She lost her job during the Covid period but hopes to go back to work sometime soon.

She sees her health is deteriorating. She does not have the energy/stamina to do a lot of the things she used to do especially around the house. Her  hands don’t seem to function the way they should and is contemplating cutting her hair because of this. Does not feel social and  has been staying pretty much to herself lately. Gets frustrated because she’s not able to do things around the house and other family members are not picking up the slack so it doesn’t get done. Trying to rely on God and reading more scripture in a different way to understand what is supposed to mean to her.

Judy-has been doing pretty good lately. She learned how to order groceries online through Amazon. Judy is expecting a delivery today and the good thing about it is delivery occur on the same day of the order.  Feels good she does not have to rely on others. Her  granddaughter is still beautiful but no direct contact. 

Delores- has been doing pretty well. Family came down to visit her this past weekend and she overdid it by walking more than she normally would. They went out to dinner downtown and later she went out to the store. Now her joints and legs are more swollen than normal. Also a little leery of being exposed since she was out in the public more than she had been for sometime. 

Maya- has been doing pretty well but busy trying to make sure everything is in order before she has surgery on November 4. It was nice that her neighbor helped out with some cat food recently and she had just gone to Walmart for more cat food tonight. She is concerned because she was advised not to do anything for six weeks which is very hard for her. She is used to providing and not used to relying on others.","Trust

She’s been undergoing various test and appears to be localized with some lymph node involvement. Roxanna had a second opinion at UCSD where her sister works for an oncologist who specializes in G.I. cancers. She was told that the treatment plan she was advised through her insurance which is Kaiser is correct which made her feel better. Her mom is going to move in with her to try to help during this time although her mother cannot drive and has her own issues so it will be an adjustment for both. Patient has the option of going out on disability or working periodically and she will play it by ear depending on how she feels with the treatment.

Sydney-has continued to have issues with nerve pain. She tries to work around it but has had to try to isolate herself from the customers and work in the back during this past week. Sydney has noted some hair loss which was pointed out to her by her father multiple times which made her feel really badSuch that she missed work which she never does. Her mother helped her change her hair.  Mom even went out and cut her hair short like her. Sydney felt much better after that

Maya-currently out on disability after a fall  and suffering a concussion. She continues to have issues with pain. She is having some issues related to her ex-husband and the effects it’s caused on her daughter. Her daughter talked a long time about what she’s been going through in her life suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and recently it’s gotten worse with her dad-threatens To have her go back to her old school. Even though he’s not able to do that because he does not have custody and it was already decided in court her daughter remains fearful because she loves her new school. Through the new school she’s been able to volunteer at Sharp and wants to get into the medical field

Judy-She continues to have issues with memory, pain in seizures prevent her from driving. Her mother takes her everywhere even though she has friends who have volunteered to help her. Mom appears to be overbearing even going to her mental health appointments in sitting in for the first half of it describing what’s transpired in the past month. Judy would like to change this in hopes to not have her mother be so overbearing. May discuss this with mother or during the next counseling session with both the counselor and mother together

Delores- Recently had her garage broken into and now just getting  the locks put back on. Had to move some of her valuable stuff out of the garage into her house. Patient continues to go to doctors appointments. Continues to get confused with what they say and when she tries to press them to write it down was told recently she would have to pay for information just to have an idea of how many steroid injection she’s having her knees. Delores is also worried about her granddaughter and her friends. Trying to decide which is the best middle school for her to attend.

Nikki- she continues to have different diagnoses. She continues to have pain issues and fatigue. Recently had some testing done in abnormality noted on the liver. Advised to come in to talk about the results. Does not have transportation to come in on Friday. One of the other participants in this support group volunteered  to drive her to the appointment on Friday so she does not have to wait until next week to find out what’s going on.","Faith

Deloris - still trying to find another doctor. Having trouble controlling and managing pain.

Crystal - spoke with via telephone. Will not be coming to group for awhile, its a hour and a half travel time round trip, she homeschools her children and also leads the Girl Scout Troop for her daughter, so it is a lot in the middle of the week.

The topic was ""BUT GOD"". Speaking on every emotion that is being felt is valid and is part the personal journey, but its not the end. There is always a ""but God"" because He is bigger that every medicine, side effect, prognosis, fear, etc. Asked each member to share their biggest struggle at the moment, but to finish the sentence with ""but God"" and share what God is doing in and through them.

Hanna was very emotional wanting to know what her purpose was in having the cancer he had.  She is in remission now but is not sure what to think or how to act.  The thought of the cancer coming back is constantly in the back of her mind and she is looking to God for guidance.

These were the topics and for many of us from different levels of our experience we were able to discuss that God is in charge and we must continue to trust.

Vanessa is a cancer survivor who was diagnosed when she was 19 years old in the late 90's.  She described how doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong when she first got sick but an X-ray to the chest reveled the mass that she was cured from through treatment.  She was going through college at the time and describes the hardship of having to stop school and endure something that at that time was not really well known.  She wished there was a cancer care support group when she was diagnosed because she felt so alone and never really got the support she needed.  She had a relapsed twice with the cancer and through treatment beat it both times.  Now she is a nurse married with two beautiful children and husband wanting to do more with helping people with cancer.  It was a pleasure having her at the support group, and from our conversation it was evident she was happy to connect to people who have endured the hardships of cancer and know the feelings that come with it.


Edward Claudio  claudioedward@yahoo.com  619-421-8092
Edward is Vanessa's husband and huge supporter of his wife helping people with cancer.  He was very emotional during the support group about his wife being a cancer survivor and opened up about his cousin Danny who  he lost to cancer when he was a teenager in the mid 90's.  Vanessa didn't realize how impacted her husband was by the lost of his cousin until he opened up at the group.  Edward described seeing his cousin endure the pains of the treatments and saying goodbye and how he thought about killing himself after his cousin died so he wouldn't be alone.  There was a lot of pain Edward held inside about his cousin Danny and I was blessed to have been able to listen to him as he opened his heart.  Edward has a heart to help those with cancer and will be praying about what direction he should go, weather its to volunteer with cancer care or helping out his wife where he can.

Lizeth is my wife who doesn't normally go to the groups because she is still having a difficult time with everything that has happened to our family when our daughter got cancer, but decided to join us today.  She gave her testimony and shared some of her pains that cancer brought to our lives and continues to bring.  She has come a long way in being able to open up about our lives, but I know she still has a lot of healing to do and I pray God continues to guide me in helping her in any way I can.","Discussion today was giving of our Testimony and how cancer has affected our lives.

She was on a college group trip traveling from England to France.  The night of the attacks Eugene's daughter described to him how a student invited her and a few other students to a concert but she decided not to go.  Later that night they heard gun fire a few blocks down and ran for their lives.  Eugene was contacted by the US embassy in France that night letting him know his daughter was safe but that she was not able to go home because France closed off all its borders.  Eugene opened up about the anxaity of not knowing if his daughter was safe when he first heard about the attacks and wanting to go down there and bring her home but having to wait.  His daughter is back home and doing better now but the student that went to the concert was killed in the attack.  The only thing we know is she was from Long Beach, Ca.  Many prayers for this young girl who lost her life and the many victims from the attack.  
On the way out after the meeting we ran into a cleaning staff member who asked what were about and opened up about how his son use to have cancer and currently his wife has cancer.

Andrew is  a cancer patient Eugene has been in contact with giving support and prayer through email and phone.  In the third week of October Andrew was facing a financial crisis in which he was going to be short on rent $1,000.  Andrew felt helpless not being able to help his family because of his condition and asked for prayer.  
God is good because last week Andrew contacted Eugene and let us know God answered his prayer and medical claim he has been waiting for came through and produced enough money to keep Andrew and his family going.  Prayer request is for better health and support for his family.

Debbie is a prior volunteer who has lost a few family member to cancer and ex husband was a cancer survivor.  She has had to leave the group for the past few months but I have kept in contact via email and phone.  She is in need of prayer because of a previous marriage that has ended with her husband relapsing in drugs and becoming violent.  Debbie's husband  is currently behind bars and she is going through the court system to make sure he gets the help needed there.  She asked for prayer in protection and guidance.  

I was gone since the beginning of September to October traveling from San Diego to L.A by foot carrying a cross spreading the Gospel raising awareness for children with cancer.   It feels good to be back but I have been spiritually attacked since the end of my journey, and am asking for prayer in continually seeking what God wants and putting Him first in my life.  My daughter who is a cancer survivor is struggling with her PTSD from what she went through when she had cancer.  I ask for prayer that she gets better, and that God uses us to help others.","2 Timothy 1:7 ""For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.""
